            <div>
                <p>This Privacy Policy describes our privacy practices related to your access and use of TushBank Services and the TushBank Platform.</p>
                <br>
                <p>TushBank Services. When we say “TushBank Services” or “Services,” this means the products and services that are made available and directly provided by TushBank, Inc. or its subsidiaries and affiliates, including TushBank CN, TushBank KZ. and TushBank Advisory, Inc. through our websites and mobile applications. This includes, for example, our lending, credit, financial planning, and insurance products and services.</p>
                <br>
                <p>TushBank Platform. When we say “TushBank Platform,” this means the technology platform that TushBank provides to its partners and third-party service providers to enable them to provide their products and services to you. This includes, for example, our partners’ and third-party service providers’ websites and mobile applications that are powered by TushBank’s technology.</p>
                <br>
                <p>We encourage you to read the entire Privacy Policy. By becoming a TushBank member or using the TushBank Platform and Services, you acknowledge that you have read and agree to the Privacy Policy. Your use of the TushBank Platform and Services is subject to the TushBank Terms of Use (the “Terms”). We use the same terms here as in Terms. We will let you know in this Privacy Policy if we have a new or different definition of a term.</p>

            <summary>Information We Collect</summary>
            <div>
                <p>When we say “Personal Information,” we use this as a general term to mean information that can be any information about an individual from which that person can be reasonably identified. </p>
                <br>
                <h3>Information we collect directly from you.</h3>
                <p>We may collect Personal Information directly from you when you use the TushBank Platform and Services — for example, when you register to become a member or request to prequalify for a third-party credit card or investment product.</p>
                <br>
                <h3>Here are the types of Personal Information we may collect:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Contact and registration information.</strong> Information you provide when you sign up to become a member, activate a subscription, or upload information into the TushBank Platform or Service, including your name, title and honorifics, email address, mailing address, phone number, date of birth, username, and password.</li>
                    <li><strong>Identity information.</strong> Information to verify your identity, including your name, date of birth, social security number, driver’s license number or other government-issued identification, or similar information.</li>

                <br>
                <p>We do not store your third-party financial account ID or passwords. Instead, we securely pass this information to our third-party partners when you request services that require us to confirm your identity, when you request to prequalify for their products, and/or to provide you with access to your financial information on the TushBank Platform or Services.</p>
                <br>

You hereby consent to TushBank processing your information disclosed by the Bank in connection with “Non-Bank Services” (as described in the Terms) in accordance with this Privacy Policy. In all other instances, the Bank’s privacy policy controls over this Privacy Policy, but only with respect to information collected, obtained, or created in connection with the Bank Services.</p>
                <br>
